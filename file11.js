//undefined



let firstname;
console.log(firstname);//--output-undefined(when a variable is made and no values are added it shows undefined)
//you can do this with let and var but cannot do with const it wil give a syntaxerror

firstname="test";

console.log(typeof(firstname),firstname)


//null
let testvariable=null;
console.log(typeof(testvariable))///output--object
